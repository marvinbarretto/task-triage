# Task Triage App - Problem Space Summary

## Core Problem
People struggle with task prioritization when overwhelmed. They need a systematic way to get everything out of their head and understand why Task A should come before Task B, but existing tools either oversimplify or overcomplicate the process.

## User Pain Points

### Brain Dump Challenge
- Users have 10-20 mixed tasks swirling in their head
- Tasks come from different contexts (work emails, personal notes, random thoughts)
- Current state: Everything feels equally urgent and important
- Need: Quick way to externalize everything without losing items

### Priority Confusion
- "I know I should do X, but I keep doing Y instead"
- Difficulty distinguishing between genuinely urgent vs just loud/visible tasks
- Lack of systematic framework for comparing different types of work
- Need: Transparent scoring that shows WHY something ranks higher

###  Decision Fatigue
- Constantly re-evaluating what to work on next
- Mental energy wasted on meta-work (deciding what to do)
- Analysis paralysis when everything seems important
- Need: Front-load the thinking, then just follow the list

### Context Switching Overhead
- Traditional tools ask: "Rate this task 1-10 for urgency, 1-10 for impact..."
- Cognitive load of switching between different evaluation criteria per task
- Need: Stay in one "evaluation mode" and blast through all tasks

## User Workflow Problems
### Current Broken Flow
1. User feels overwhelmed
2. Opens todo app, starts typing tasks
3. Gets distracted by trying to organize while capturing
4. Half the tasks don't get entered
5. Tasks that do get entered lack context for priority decisions
6. User ends up working on whatever feels easiest/most fun

### Desired Improved Flow
1. Brain dump everything quickly (no organization pressure)
2. Systematic evaluation using consistent criteria
3. Clear priority ranking with transparent reasoning
4. Work from the top down with confidence

## Key Insights from User Research/Behavior
- Volume sweet spot: 10-20 tasks (more = analysis paralysis, fewer = not really overwhelmed)
- Evaluation preference: Category-by-category faster than task-by-task
- Scoring complexity: 3-point scale reduces decision fatigue vs 5/10-point scales
- Transparency need: Users want to understand the "why" behind rankings
- Configuration desire: People want control but need good defaults

## Success Metrics
- Capture completeness: Users get all tasks out of head in one session
- Decision confidence: Users trust the ranking and work from top down
- Time efficiency: Triage process takes <5 minutes for 15 tasks
- Cognitive relief: Users report feeling less overwhelmed after triage
- Behavioral change: Users actually work on high-priority items vs default behaviors

## User Types
- Knowledge workers drowning in mixed personal/professional tasks
- Project managers needing quick stakeholder priority alignment
- Students balancing assignments, applications, personal tasks
- Anyone periodically overwhelmed by accumulated responsibilities

## Context: Why Existing Solutions Don't Work
- Simple todo apps: No prioritization framework
- Complex project management: Too heavy for personal task triage
- Getting Things Done: Good methodology, poor digital implementation
- Priority matrices: Theoretical frameworks without practical workflow tools

This is fundamentally about cognitive load reduction and decision-making frameworks rather than task storage or project management.
